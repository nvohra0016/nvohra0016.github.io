## Battery energy storage systems (BESS)

BESS holds an important role in various avenues of power systems, from complementing renewable energy sources (such as Solar) to participating in electricity markets for arbitrage and ancillary services. The basic set of linearized equations for BESS are as follows [[1]]

$$SOC_n = SOC_{n-1} + \tau\left(\eta P^c_n - \frac{1}{\eta}P^d_n\right)$$
