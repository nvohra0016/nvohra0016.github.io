To study the land subsidence caused by thawing permafrost, one needs to analyze the coupling of the different mechanisms involved. Namely, these are deformation, flow, and energy. Analyzing these together, however, leads to numerically expensive complications and hence they must be studied individually and then coupled in a simpler fashion.
