## About me:

I am Naren Vohra and I am a fourth year PhD candidate at the Oregon State University Mathematics department. I am interested in applied and computational mathematics, particularly to model fluid flow and mechanical deformation. Currently, I am studying the thermo-hydro-mechanical coupling that governs the dynamics of permafrost thaw.
