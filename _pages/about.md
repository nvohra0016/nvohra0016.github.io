## About me:

I am a fourth year PhD candidate at the Oregon State University Mathematics department. I am interested in applied and computational mathematics, particularly to model fluid flow and mechanical deformation. Currently, I am studying the thermo-hydro-mechanical coupling that governs the dynamics of permafrost thaw. 

### Interests: 
- Poroelasticity
- Phase transition
- Thermo-hydro-mechanical models
- Computational fluid dynamics

I am also fond of reading classics. Among my favourite authors are Marcel Proust and Virginia Woolf.
