## About me:

I am a postdoc at Los Alamos National Laboratory in the Applied Mathematics and Plasma Physics (T5) division. I completed my Ph.D. in Mathematics from Oregon State University. I am interested in applied and computational mathematics, particularly to model fluid flow and mechanical deformation. 

### Interests: 
- Poroelasticity
- Heat conduction with phase transition
- Thermo-hydro-mechanical models
- Computational fluid dynamics

I am also fond of reading classics. Among my favourite authors are Marcel Proust, Virginia Woolf, Fyodor Dostoevsky and Ernest Hemingway.
