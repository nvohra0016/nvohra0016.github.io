## About me:

I am a computational mathematician who is currently working at Aurora Energy Research as an energy modelling analyst. I completed my Ph.D. in Mathematics from Oregon State University and my postdoctoral studies from Los 
Alamos National Lab. I am interested in applied and computational mathematics, particularly with applications in geosciences.

### Interests: 
- Computational modelling of physical processes
- Power market modelling
- Battery energy storage systems
- Multiscale multiphysics processes
- Thermo-hydro-mechanical models
- Surface and subsurface flow modeling
- Multiphase flow modeling
- Computational fluid dynamics
