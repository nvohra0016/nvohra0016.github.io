## About me:

I am a fifth year PhD candidate at the Oregon State University Mathematics department. I am interested in applied and computational mathematics, particularly to model fluid flow and mechanical deformation. Currently, I am studying the thermo-hydro-mechanical coupling that governs the dynamics of thawing ice-rich porous media, like permafrost.

### Interests: 
- Poroelasticity
- Heat conduction with phase transition
- Thermo-hydro-mechanical models
- Computational fluid dynamics

I am also fond of reading classics. Among my favourite authors are Marcel Proust, Virginia Woolf, Fyodor Dostoevsky and Ernest Hemingway.
