## About me:

I am a computational mathematician who is currently working at Aurora Energy Research as an energy modelling analyst. I completed my Ph.D. in Mathematics from Oregon State University and my postdoctoral studies from Los 
Alamos National Lab. I am interested in applied and computational mathematics, particularly with applications in power systems and geosciences. 

### Interests: 
- Computational modelling of physical processes
- Power market modelling
- Battery energy storage systems
- Multiscale multiphysics processes
- Thermo-hydro-mechanical models
- Surface and subsurface flow modeling
- Multiphase flow modeling

I relocated to Gurugram, Haryana in 2024 where I currently stay with my wife. Outside of work, I enjoy reading classics. Among my favourite authors are Marcel Proust, Thomas Mann, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Virginia Woolf, and Ernest Hemingway.


## Technical blog:

I also maintain a [blog](https://nvohra0016.github.io/talks/) on my website where I write expository short articles to motivate existing or novel ideas. My recent posts are:


- [Neural Networks I: First Network from Scratch](https://nvohra0016.github.io/talks/neural_network1/)
`Neural network' `forecasting' `Recusrive neural network' `Gradient descent'
- [Accelerating Convergence of Newton’s Method for Degenerate Functions
](https://nvohra0016.github.io/talks/newtons_method/)  
`Newtons method` `Butler Volmer` `convergence`
- [An Introduction to Kalman Filters Using the Heat Equation](https://nvohra0016.github.io/talks/kalman_filter/)  
`Kalman filter`, `heat equation`, `Monte Carlo`, `ODE`
